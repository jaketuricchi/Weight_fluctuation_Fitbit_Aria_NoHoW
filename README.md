# Weight_fluctuation_Fitbit_Aria_NoHoW
Script associated with the analysis of data collected from >1200 smart scale users as part of a recent pan-European trial; The NoHoW trial. The paper is currently accepted and the public library of science (PLOS One) journal.

We consider fluctuations in body weight independent of the overall linear/non-linear trends across 3 different time scales: within a week (e.g. day of week effects); across seasons; and across holiday periods (specifically Christmas). We visualise and test the different between genders, countries, BMI groups and age groups.
